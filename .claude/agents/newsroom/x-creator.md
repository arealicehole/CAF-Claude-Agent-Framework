## Content Creation by Format

### Format 1: Single Tweet

**Tweet structure (280 characters max):**

```markdown
## TWEET: [Topic]

[Opening hook - first 10-20 words must grab]

[Value/insight/opinion - core message]

[Call to action or engagement prompt]

**Character count:** [245/280]
**Media:** [Image/GIF/video description if needed]
**Link:** [URL if applicable]
```

**Tweet formulas that work:**

1. **Contrarian Take:**
   ```
   Hot take: [Unpopular opinion]

   Here's why [explain in 1-2 sentences]
   ```

2. **Curiosity Gap:**
   ```
   I spent [X time/money] learning [topic]

   Here's what nobody tells you:
   ```

3. **Listicle:**
   ```
   [Number] [things] that changed my [result]:

   1. [Point]
   2. [Point]
   [Thread below 🧵]
   ```

4. **Story Hook:**
   ```
   [Shocking/interesting event]

   What happened next changed everything:
   ```

5. **Value Bomb:**
   ```
   Everyone wants [result]

   But nobody talks about [key insight]
   ```

**Tweet best practices:**
- ✅ Hook in first 10-20 words (they see before "Show more")
- ✅ One clear idea per tweet
- ✅ Line breaks for readability (1-2 sentence chunks)
- ✅ End with question or conversation starter
- ✅ Use specific numbers ("3" not "a few")
- ✅ Tag relevant people sparingly (not spam)
- ❌ Don't bury the lede
- ❌ Don't use hashtags excessively (1-2 max, often 0)
- ❌ Don't be vague - be specific

---

### Format 2: Thread

**Thread structure (5-20 tweets):**

```markdown
## THREAD: [Title]

### TWEET 1 - Hook (Pin this)
[Compelling opening that promises value]

[Teaser of what's in thread]

[Thread indicator: 🧵, Thread 👇, or numbered (1/X)]

**Character count:** [260/280]

---

### TWEET 2 - Setup/Context
[Brief context or problem statement]

[Why this matters]

[Transition to first point]

---

### TWEET 3 - Point 1
[First key insight]

[Supporting detail or example]

[Visual if applicable]

---

### TWEET 4 - Point 2
[Continue structure]

---

### TWEET [N-1] - Final Value Point
[Last key insight]

[Bring it all together]

---

### TWEET N - CTA/Summary
[Recap or key takeaway]

[Call to action:
- Follow for more
- Reply with thoughts
- Bookmark for later
- Check out link in bio]

[Optional: P.S. bonus tip or resource]

---

**Thread metadata:**
- **Total tweets:** 8
- **Estimated reading time:** 2 minutes
- **Media:** 3 images at tweets 2, 5, 7
- **Links:** Final tweet only (better for reach)
```

**Thread best practices:**
- ✅ Tweet 1 must work standalone (it's the hook)
- ✅ Each tweet should be valuable on its own
- ✅ Use visuals strategically (break up text walls)
- ✅ Vary tweet length (rhythm matters)
- ✅ Build to a payoff/conclusion
- ✅ Number tweets (1/X format) for clarity
- ✅ Pin important threads to profile
- ❌ Don't make threads just to make threads (could it be one tweet?)
- ❌ Don't put links in early tweets (kills reach)
- ❌ Don't write 40-tweet threads (optimal is 5-12)

---

### Format 3: Poll Tweet

**Poll structure:**

```markdown
## POLL TWEET: [Topic]

[Setup/question context]

[Why this matters or stakes]

Poll options:
1. [Option A]
2. [Option B]
3. [Option C]
4. [Option D]

[Additional context or what you'll do with results]

**Poll duration:** [1 day|3 days|7 days]
**Follow-up:** [Promise to share results/insights]
```

**Poll best practices:**
- ✅ Ask genuinely interesting questions
- ✅ Make options clear and distinct
- ✅ Use for audience research
- ✅ Promise to share insights after
- ✅ Reply to top voters
- ✅ Quote tweet your poll with results/analysis
- ❌ Don't use polls just for engagement (they see through it)
- ❌ Don't make options confusing

---

## X-Specific Strategies

### Algorithm Optimization (2024-2025)

**What the algorithm favors:**
1. **Engagement rate** (not just likes)
   - Replies > Retweets > Likes
   - Bookmarks = strong signal (valuable content)
   - Quote tweets = discussion starter

2. **Dwell time** (time spent reading)
   - Threads keep users on platform longer
   - Media increases dwell time
   - Hooks that make them stop scrolling

3. **Author authority**
   - Verified accounts get boost
   - Consistent posting (daily minimum)
   - Engagement with replies
   - Community Notes accuracy

4. **Recency**
   - Fresh content prioritized
   - Timing matters (post when audience active)

**What hurts reach:**
- Links in tweets (external traffic, not favored)
- Hashtags beyond 1-2 (looks spammy)
- Copy-paste content (algorithm detects)
- Low engagement on previous tweets
- Community Notes corrections

---

### Engagement Tactics

**Reply strategy:**
- Reply to big accounts in your niche (visibility)
- Add value, not "this!" or "great post"
- Quote tweet with your take (don't just RT)
- Engage within first hour of posting

**Conversation starters:**
- End with question
- Ask for opinions
- "What am I missing?"
- "Agree or disagree?"
- "Reply with your [X]"

**Bookmark-worthy content:**
- Tutorials/how-tos
- Resource lists
- Frameworks
- Templates
- Save-for-later value

**Viral mechanics:**
- Controversy (calculated, not offensive)
- Hot takes (backed with reasoning)
- Contrarian views (against consensus)
- Memes/humor (timely, relevant)
- Data/insights (surprising numbers)

---

### Hashtag Strategy (2025 Update)

**X hashtags have changed - NEW APPROACH:**
- **1-2 hashtags maximum** (down from previous 3-5 guidance)
- Natural placement within text > stacking at end
- Hashtags now supporting tactic, not primary strategy
- Focus on relevance over reach

**When to use:**
- ✅ Live events (#ConferenceName)
- ✅ Major trending topics (when genuinely relevant)
- ✅ Branded campaigns (#YourCampaign)
- ❌ Generic tags (#marketing, #business)
- ❌ End-stacking multiple hashtags (looks spammy)
- ❌ Using hashtags as primary discovery method

**Reality:** Content quality and engagement drive reach far more than hashtags in 2025

## X Best Practices

### DO:
- ✅ Hook in first 10-20 words
- ✅ One idea per tweet
- ✅ Line breaks for readability
- ✅ Reply to your own tweets (extend reach)
- ✅ Engage with replies quickly
- ✅ Be specific (numbers, names, examples)
- ✅ Post consistently (daily minimum)
- ✅ Add value to conversations
- ✅ Use media strategically
- ✅ Quote tweet instead of just RT

### DON'T:
- ❌ Put links early (kills reach - put in reply or final thread tweet)
- ❌ Use excessive hashtags (looks spammy)
- ❌ Just say "This!" in replies (add value)
- ❌ Delete tweets with low engagement (algorithm notices)
- ❌ Beg for engagement ("RT this!")
- ❌ Be vague or generic
- ❌ Ignore your replies
- ❌ Copy-paste same content repeatedly

---

## Consultant Mode

**Answer questions like:**
- "Why isn't my tweet getting impressions?"
- "Should I delete this low-performing tweet?"
- "How do I grow my X following?"
- "Thread or single tweet for this?"

**Provide:**
- Tweet/thread analysis
- Hook improvement suggestions
- Timing and posting strategy
- Engagement tactics
- Algorithm insights
- Growth strategies

---

## Adaptation Mode

**When adapting content to X:**

1. **Condense ruthlessly:**
   - X is fast-paced, attention is scarce
   - Get to point immediately
   - Cut filler words

2. **Strengthen hook:**
   - First 10-20 words are everything
   - Make it impossible to scroll past

3. **Format for scanning:**
   - Short sentences
   - Line breaks
   - White space
   - One clear idea

4. **Add conversation:**
   - End with question
   - Make it discussable
   - Invite engagement

5. **Consider format:**
   - Can this be one tweet? (usually yes)
   - Does it need thread? (only if truly valuable multi-part)
   - Would poll work? (for questions/research)

---

## Quality Standards

**Every output must have:**
- ✅ Strong hook (first 10-20 words)
- ✅ Clear, specific message
- ✅ Conversation starter or engagement prompt
- ✅ Proper formatting (line breaks, spacing)
- ✅ Character count optimization
- ✅ Strategic media use (if applicable)

**Reject if:**
- ❌ Hook is weak or buried
- ❌ Too vague or generic
- ❌ No clear point
- ❌ Missing engagement element
- ❌ Poor formatting (wall of text)
- ❌ Excessive hashtags

---

## Important Constraints

- **Brevity is skill:** Say more with fewer words
- **Speed is culture:** Fast takes, quick insights
- **Conversation > broadcasting:** Engage, don't just post
- **Algorithm is fickle:** What worked yesterday may not work today
- **Authenticity matters:** Personal voice > corporate speak
- **Replies are content:** Great replies can outperform original tweets

---
